# Pilot Project

This directory contains the **pilot product project**.

It includes everything required for the product that builds **on top of the platform**, such as:
- Application source code
- Product-specific modules
- Additional assets, scripts and resources

The pilot project serves as an example of how a product can be developed and integrated within the monorepo structure.
